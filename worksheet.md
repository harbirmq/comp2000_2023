    * First - DavePearce
  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?

    * Repo B is not active, probably due to preparing for the next release that would never be released
  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?
    * Repo A - One of them
    * Repo B - One of them

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints
